<h2 class="lsp">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the
noble deeds with which the Military History of our
country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier,
and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have
given rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall in future keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services, and of acts of individual
bravery, can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's
Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore;" and when
half the World has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,
our fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us, will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<h2 class="lsp">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The ancient Armies of England were composed
of Horse and Foot; but the feudal troops established
by William the Conqueror in 1086, consisted
almost entirely of Horse. Under the feudal
system, every holder of land amounting to what
was termed a "knight's fee," was required to
provide a charger, a coat of mail, a helmet, a
shield, and a lance, and to serve the Crown a
period of forty days in each year at his own
expense; and the great landholders had to provide
armed men in proportion to the extent of
their estates; consequently the ranks of the feudal
Cavalry were completed with men of property,
and the vassals and tenants of the great barons,
who led their dependents to the field in person.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reigns the Cavalry of the
Army was composed of Knights (or men at arms)
and Hobiliers (or horsemen of inferior degree);
and the Infantry of spears and battle-axe men,
cross-bowmen, and archers. The Knights wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
armour on every part of the body, and their
weapons were a lance, a sword, and a small
dagger. The Hobiliers were accoutred and armed
for the light and less important services of war,
and were not considered qualified for a charge in
line. Mounted Archers<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were also introduced,
and the English nation eventually became pre-eminent
in the use of the bow.</p>

<p>About the time of Queen Mary the appellation
of "<em>Men at Arms</em>" was changed to that of "<em>Spears</em>
and <em>Launces</em>." The introduction of fire-arms ultimately
occasioned the lance to fall into disuse,
and the title of the Horsemen of the first degree
was changed to "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cuirassiers</i>." The Cuirassiers
were armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pié</i>, and their weapons were a
sword with a straight narrow blade and sharp
point, and a pair of large pistols, called petronels;
and the Hobiliers carried carbines. The Infantry
carried pikes, matchlocks, and swords. The
introduction of fire-arms occasioned the formation
of Regiments armed and equipped as infantry,
but mounted on small horses for the sake of
expedition of movement, and these were styled
"<em>Dragoons</em>;" a small portion of the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
force of the kingdom, however, consisted of this
description of troops.</p>

<p>The formation of the present Army commenced
after the Restoration in 1660, with the establishment
of regular corps of Horse and Foot; the
Horsemen were cuirassiers, but only wore armour
on the head and body; and the Foot were pike-men
and musketeers. The arms which each
description of force carried, are described in the
following extract from the "Regulations of King
Charles II.," dated 5th May, 1663:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Each Horseman to have for his defensive
armes, back, breast, and pot; and for his offensive
armes, a sword, and a case of pistolls, the
barrels whereof are not to be und<sup>r</sup>. foorteen
inches in length; and each Trooper of Our
Guards to have a carbine besides the aforesaid
armes. And the Foote to have each souldier a
sword, and each pikeman a pike of 16 foote
long and not und<sup>r</sup>.; and each musqueteer a
musquet with a collar of bandaliers, the barrell
of which musquet to be about foor foote long
and to conteine a bullet, foorteen of which shall
weigh a pound weight<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>."</p></div>

<p>The ranks of the Troops of Horse were at this
period composed of men of some property&mdash;generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the sons of substantial yeomen: the young
men received as recruits provided their own horses,
and they were placed on a rate of pay sufficient
to give them a respectable station in society.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war with Holland
in the spring of 1672, a Regiment of Dragoons
was raised<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the Dragoons were placed on a lower
rate of pay than the Horse, and the Regiment
was armed similar to the Infantry, excepting that
a limited number of the men carried halberds
instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets;
and a few men in each troop had pistols;
as appears by a warrant dated the 2nd of April,
1672, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<p class="in3">"Our will and pleasure is, that a Regiment
of Dragoones which we have established
and ordered to be raised, in twelve Troopes of
fourscore in each beside officers, who are to be
under the command of Our most deare and most
intirely beloved Cousin Prince Rupert, shall
be armed out of Our stoares remaining within
Our office of the Ordinance, as followeth; that

carry each of them one halbard, and one case
of pistolls with holsters; and the rest of the
souldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are
to have and to carry each of them one matchlocke
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, and
also to have and to carry one bayonet<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, or great
knive. That each lieutenant have and carry

out for each Troope of the said Regiment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p>
</div>

<p>Several regiments of Horse and Dragoons
were raised in the first year of the reign of King
James II.; and the horsemen carried a short carbine<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in addition to the sword and pair of pistols:
and in a Regulation dated the 21st of February,
1687, the arms of the Dragoons at that period
were commanded to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Dragoons to have snaphanse musquets,
strapt, with bright barrels of three foote eight
inches long, cartouch-boxes, bayonetts, granado
pouches, buckets, and hammer-hatchetts."</p>
</div>

<p>After several years' experience, little advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>was found to accrue from having Cavalry Regiments
formed almost exclusively for engaging the
enemy on foot; and, the Horse having laid aside
their armour, the arms and equipment of Horse
and Dragoons were so nearly assimilated, that
there remained little distinction besides the name
and rate of pay. The introduction of improvements
into the mounting, arming, and equipment
of Dragoons rendered them competent to the
performance of every description of service required
of Cavalry; and, while the long musket
and bayonet were retained, to enable them to act
as Infantry, if necessary, they were found to be
equally efficient, and of equal value to the nation,
as Cavalry, with the Regiments of Horse.</p>

<p>In the several augmentations made to the
regular Army after the early part of the reign of
Queen Anne, no new Regiments of Horse were
raised for permanent service; and in 1746 King
George II. reduced three of the old Regiments
of Horse to the quality and pay of Dragoons; at
the same time, His Majesty gave them the title of
First, Second, and Third Regiments of <em>Dragoon
Guards</em>: and in 1788 the same alteration was
made in the remaining four Regiments of Horse,
which then became the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Regiments of <em>Dragoon Guards</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>At present there are only three Regiments
which are styled <em>Horse</em> in the British Army,
namely, the two Regiments of Life Guards, and
the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, to whom
cuirasses have recently been restored. The other
Cavalry Regiments consist of Dragoon Guards
Heavy and Light Dragoons, Hussars, and Lancers;
and although the long musket and bayonet
have been laid aside by the whole of the Cavalry,
and the Regiments are armed and equipped on
the principle of the old Horse (excepting the
cuirass), they continue to be styled Dragoons.</p>

<p>The old Regiments of Horse formed a highly
respectable and efficient portion of the Army,
and it is found, on perusing the histories of the
various campaigns in which they have been engaged,
that they have, on all occasions, maintained
a high character for steadiness and discipline as
well as for bravery in action. They were formerly
mounted on horses of superior weight and physical
power, and few troops could withstand a
well-directed charge of the celebrated British
Horse. The records of these corps embrace a
period of 150 years&mdash;a period eventful in history,
and abounding in instances of heroism displayed
by the British troops when danger has threatened
the nation,&mdash;a period in which these Regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
have numbered in their ranks men of loyalty,
valour, and good conduct, worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>Since the Regiments of Horse were formed
into Dragoon Guards, additional improvements
have been introduced into the constitution of the
several corps; and the superior description of
horses now bred in the United Kingdom, enables
the commanding officers to remount their regiments
with such excellent horses, that, whilst
sufficient weight has been retained for a powerful
charge in line, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'alightness has'">a lightness has</ins> been acquired, which
renders them available for every description of
service incident to modern warfare.</p>

<p>The orderly conduct of these Regiments in
quarters has gained the confidence and esteem of
the respectable inhabitants of the various parts of
the United Kingdom in which they have been
stationed; their promptitude and alacrity in attending
to the requisitions of the magistrates in
periods of excitement, and the temper, patience,
and forbearance which they have evinced when
subjected to great provocation, insult, and violence
from the misguided populace, prove the value of
these troops to the Crown, and to the Government
of the country, and justify the reliance which is
reposed in them.</p>

<h2>ON THE INSTITUTION<br />

<span class="fs60">OF</span><br />

LIGHT CAVALRY</h2>

<p class="pfs70">IN</p>

<p class="pfs150 lsp">THE BRITISH ARMY.</p>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The records of the military events of the remote
ages speak of heavy-armed horsemen being accompanied
by others mounted and equipped for light
services. The Barons and Knights, who rode the
powerful horses celebrated by historians, and took
the field completely cased in steel, had a few
light-armed attendants; the feudal horsemen were
variously armed; and the practice of employing
Light, as well as Heavy Cavalry, was adopted, to
a limited extent, by several commanders of antiquity.
Armour, proof against arrow, lance, and
sword, and men and horses of colossal appearance,
in whom the greatest amount of weight and physical
power, consistent with a moderate share of
activity, could be combined, were however held in
the highest estimation; but eventually the great
advantage of having a portion of Cavalry in which
lightness, activity, and celerity of movement,
might form the principal characteristics, was discovered.
The introduction of fire-arms occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
armour to be gradually laid aside, or limited to a
few heavy horsemen; superiority of weight was
no longer thought so necessary; and in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries the use of Light
Cavalry became more general than formerly.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between Spain
and the United Provinces of the Netherlands,
Prince Maurice of Nassau (afterwards Prince of
Orange) selected a few English and Dutch heavy-armed
Lancers, and constituted them <em>Carabineers</em>,
for skirmishing, and other services of a similar
character. The Emperor of Germany formed
regiments of Hungarian <em>Hussars</em>, who were light
men on small horses. The Carabineers were
of an intermediate class, being much heavier
than the Hussars, and lighter than the English
Lancers and Cuirassiers, who rode powerful
horses, and wore armour on the head, body, and
limbs. The French monarchs adopted the practice
of having a few Carabineers in each troop of
Horse; and, in 1690, Louis XIV. added a troop
of Carabineers to each Regiment of Cavalry.
During the campaign of 1691, these troops formed
a Carabineer brigade; but their motley appearance,
and the defects of the plan, occasioned them
to be constituted a regiment of Carabineers,
and clothed in blue. In 1693 the French King
added a regiment of Hussars to the Cavalry of
his army.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In England the same principle was partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
carried out; the heavy horse laid aside their
armour, excepting cuirasses; they were mounted
on horses of less weight than formerly, and they
were supplied with carbines by King Charles II.
In 1685, King James II. raised several independent
troops of <em>Light Horse</em>, and one of them (Sir
Thomas Burton's) was retained in his service until
the Revolution in 1688, when it was disbanded.
In 1691&ndash;2 King William III. constituted the
Seventh Regiment of Horse, now Sixth Dragoon
Guards, a corps of Carabineers, as an honorary
distinction, and for the performance of services for
which the other regiments of Horse, being Cuirassiers,
were not well adapted. The object was to
combine with strength and power a greater degree
of activity and speed than was to be found in the
Cavalry at that period; and His Majesty appears
to have contemplated having several corps of this
description in his service, as he designated this
<em>the First Regiment of Carabineers</em>; but no second
regiment was formed.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In 1694 a troop of
foreign Hussars formed part of the Army commanded
by King William in Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>During the wars of Queen Anne the Regiment
of Carabineers was again supplied with cuirasses,
and was mounted on the same description
of horses as the other regiments; retaining, however,
the title of Carabineers. The activity, size,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>weight, and strength of the horses ridden by the
British Cuirassiers and Heavy Dragoons, with the
bravery and muscular powers of the men, established
their superiority in continental warfare
over the Cavalry of other nations; they acquired
great celebrity in the valley of the Danube and
on the plains of the Netherlands, in the early part
of the eighteenth century, under the renowned
John Duke of Marlborough; and after the peace
of Utrecht, in 1713, the reputation of the British
Horse and Dragoons was so high that no alteration
was thought necessary, and many years
elapsed without any attempt being made to revive
the practice of having either Carabineers, or
Light Horse, in the British Army.</p>

<p>The great utility of the Light Cavalry of the
continental armies had, in the mean time, become
apparent. Improvements in military tactics, and
in the arming and equipment of corps, were
taking place in various countries; and a spirit of
emulation extending itself to Great Britain, on
the breaking out of the rebellion in 1745, his
Grace the Duke of Montague evinced his loyalty
and public spirit by raising a Regiment of <em>Carabineers</em>
for the service of King George II.; at the
same time, his Grace the Duke of Kingston, with
equal zeal and generosity, raised, at his own expense,
a Regiment of <em>Light Horse</em>. The latter regiment
approximated, in the lightness of the men,
horses, and equipment, to the Hussars of the continental
armies; the Duke of Montague's Carabineers
were of a heavier description of Cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>At this period the old Cavalry Regiments rode
black horses (excepting the Scots Greys) with
docked tails; but the Duke of Kingston's Regiment
was mounted on light horses of various
colours, with swish or nag tails. The accoutrements
were as light as possible: the men carried
short carbines slung to their sides by a moveable
swivel, pistols, and light swords inclined to a curve.</p>

<p>The usefulness of the Duke of Kingston's
Regiment of Light Horse was proved in Scotland,
where it served under His Royal Highness the
Duke of Cumberland, and was found qualified
for every description of service; the light horses
traversing hilly grounds with facility. It distinguished
itself on several occasions, particularly
at the battle of Culloden, on the 16th of April,
1746, when it charged the clans with signal gallantry,
and evinced great spirit and activity in the
pursuit of the rebel army upwards of three miles
from the field of battle. The Duke of Cumberland
was highly pleased with its behaviour during
the period it was under his command; and the
conduct of the Light Horse throughout the contest
reflected credit on the noble peer who had
raised them.</p>

<p>The rebellion being suppressed, the regiment
was, in consequence of the conditions on which
the men had enlisted, directed to be disbanded;
but the Duke of Cumberland so highly approved
of its conduct that he obtained permission to embody
as many of the men as would re-enlist, as
his own Regiment of Light Dragoons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p>His Majesty's thanks and particular satisfaction
were communicated to His Grace the Duke
of Kingston, for his zeal and affection for His
Majesty's person and Government; and His
Grace was desired to convey to the officers and
soldiers His Majesty's high sense of their loyalty,
activity, and gallant behaviour, at a period of
national danger. The regiment was afterwards
disbanded at Nottingham, and nearly every man
engaged in the Regiment of Light Dragoons, of
which, as a signal mark of honour and distinction,
His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland
was appointed Colonel.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland's Light Dragoons
were mounted on active nag-tailed horses, from
fourteen and a-half to fifteen hands high. The
men were from five feet eight to five feet nine
inches in height; and their equipment was upon
a new and light plan, but retaining the cocked
hat of the Heavy Dragoon pattern. This regiment
served in the Netherlands, with the Army
commanded by His Royal Highness the Duke
of Cumberland: its general usefulness was fully
established, and it distinguished itself at the
battle of Val, in 1747. The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
having put an end to the war, it returned
to England, and was disbanded in 1749.</p>

<p>From this period the value of light horsemen
was more appreciated in England than formerly;
the general utility of this arm, on home and
foreign service, had been fully proved; and at
the commencement of hostilities with France, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
1755, King George II. resolved to possess the
advantage of a body of Light Cavalry in the
approaching contest. His Majesty accordingly
commanded <em>a troop of Light Dragoons</em> to be
added to the First, Second, and Third Regiments
of Dragoon Guards, and First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh
Regiments of Dragoons. The First, Second,
Third, and Fourth Irish Horse (now Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Dragoon Guards),
and the Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Twelfth, Thirteenth,
and Fourteenth Dragoons, being on the
Irish establishment, did not receive the same
addition.</p>

<p>These troops of Light Dragoons were mounted,
armed, equipped, and trained, according to specific
instructions, calculated to render them available
for the services for which they were designed.
Several of them were reviewed in Hyde Park by
His Majesty; and their neat appearance, celerity
of movement, and the spirited and exact manner
in which they performed their evolutions, were
much admired.</p>

<p>Nine of these troops were formed into a brigade
in 1758, under the command of one of the
King's aides-de-camp, Colonel George Augustus
Eliott, of the Horse Grenadier Guards; and they
were employed in the expeditions to the coast of
France under Charles Duke of Marlborough and
Lieut.-General Bligh. They landed in France
twice; skirmished with the French Cavalry; and
throughout these enterprises they evinced activity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
spirit, and general usefulness. After their return
to England, they were augmented to 125 men
per troop.</p>

<p>At this period, the war on the Continent had
involved most of the European states; and the
extended and active operations which were taking
place in Germany rendered it necessary for a
British force to join the Allied Army under
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. This gave rise
to a further augmentation of the Army; and the
increased estimation in which Light Cavalry was
held induced the King to give directions for the
raising of <em>entire Regiments of Light Dragoons</em>,
in addition to the five Regiments of Horse,
three of Dragoon Guards, and fourteen of Dragoons,
already on the British and Irish establishments.
The following corps were accordingly
embodied:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">Light Dragoons.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Incorporated in 1759.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifteenth</span>, in England, by Colonel George
A. Eliott;&mdash;now the Fifteenth, or the King's
Hussars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixteenth</span>, in England, by Lieut.-Colonel
John Burgoyne;&mdash;now the Sixteenth, or the
Queen's Lancers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, in Scotland, by Captain Lord
Aberdour;&mdash;disbanded in 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighteenth</span>, in England, by Lieut.-Colonel
John Hale;&mdash;now the Seventeenth Lancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nineteenth</span>, in Ireland, by Lieut.-Colonel
Lord Drogheda;&mdash;numbered the Eighteenth in
1763; constituted Hussars in 1807; and after
performing much valuable service at home and
abroad, it was disbanded at Newbridge, in Ireland,
in 1821.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><em>Incorporated in 1760.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twentieth</span>, in Ireland, by Captain Sir James
Caldwell;&mdash;disbanded in 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-first</span>, or Royal Foresters, in England
by Lieut.-General the Marquis of Granby,
and Colonel Lord Robert Sutton;&mdash;disbanded in
1763.</p>

<p>After the peace of Fontainebleau, three of these
corps were disbanded, and the other four continued
in the service. The light troops attached
to the heavy regiments were also disbanded, but
a few men of each troop were afterwards equipped
as Light Dragoons.</p>

<p>A more perfect knowledge of the efficiency
and capabilities of Light Cavalry, acquired during
the campaigns in Germany and Portugal, had
advanced the estimation in which that arm was
held; and, in 1768, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons (one
of the heavy regiments raised by King George I.
in 1715), underwent a change of equipment and
clothing, and was constituted a corps of <em>Light
Dragoons</em>, by General Carpenter, in Ireland.</p>

<p>This alteration served as a precedent for subsequent
changes; and further experience, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
the American war, from 1775 to 1783, confirming
the value of Light Cavalry, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>,
<span class="smcap">Eighth</span>, <span class="smcap">Ninth</span>, <span class="smcap">Tenth</span>, <span class="smcap">Eleventh</span>, <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> Regiments of Dragoons were
changed from <em>heavy</em> to <em>light</em>. The Light Dragoons
attached to the heavy regiments were incorporated
into newly-raised corps, and the following
regiments of</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Light Dragoons</p>

<p class="center"><em>Were embodied in 1779.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nineteenth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Russell Manners;&mdash;disbanded
in 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twentieth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Richard Burton
Phillipson;&mdash;disbanded in 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-first</span>,&mdash;by Major-General John Douglas;&mdash;disbanded
in 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-second</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel John Lord
Sheffield;&mdash;disbanded in 1783.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><em>Embodied in 1781.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-third</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-General Sir John
Burgoyne, Baronet, for service in India, and was
numbered the <span class="smcap">Nineteenth</span> after the peace in 1783.
This regiment signalized itself on numerous occasions
in India, and was rewarded with the honour
of bearing on its guidons and appointments the
<em>Elephant</em>, with the words <em>Assaye</em> and <em>Seringapatam</em>.
The word <em>Niagara</em> was also added in commemoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
of the gallantry of two troops, in the year
1813, in North America. In 1817 it was constituted
a corps of <span class="smcap">Lancers</span>. It was disbanded in
Ireland in 1821.</p>

<p>Thus a few years had produced a great change
in the British Army. Twenty-five years previously
to the termination of the American war
there was not a single Light Dragoon Regiment
in the Service, and in 1783 there were seventeen;
four of them were disbanded at that period, and
thirteen retained in the Service.</p>

<p>Soon after the termination of the American
war, the French monarch having, by aiding the
rebellious British provincials, taught his own subjects
a lesson of insubordination, was deprived of
the reins of government; and the violent conduct
of the French revolutionists in the West Indies
occasioned the <span class="smcap">Twentieth</span> or <span class="smcap">Jamaica Regiment
of Light Dragoons</span> to be raised in 1791 by
Colonel Henry F. Gardner, for service in that
island. Besides its services in Jamaica, detachments
of this regiment served at Malta; Sicily;
at the taking of the Cape of Good Hope, in 1806;
at the capture of Alexandria, in 1807; at the
attack on Monte Video; in Portugal; at Genoa;
and on the eastern coast of Spain; and acquired
the honour of bearing the word <em>Peninsula</em> on its
guidons and appointments. It was disbanded in
Ireland in 1818.</p>

<p>War with France commenced in 1793, and was
followed by augmentations to the Army. It
was not found necessary to add a single Heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
Cavalry Regiment; but the following Regiments
of</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Light Dragoons</p>

<p class="center"><em>Were incorporated in 1794.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-first</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel Thomas R.
Beaumont. This regiment served at the Cape of
Good Hope and in India thirteen years; a detachment
was sent to do duty at St. Helena, when
Napoleon Buonaparte was removed thither. This
regiment was disbanded at Chatham in 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-second</span>,&mdash;by Major-General William
Viscount Fielding;&mdash;served in Great Britain and
Ireland;&mdash;disbanded in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-fourth</span>,&mdash;by Colonel William Loftus;&mdash;served
in Great Britain and Ireland;&mdash;disbanded
in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-fifth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Francis
Edward Gwyn. This regiment was numbered
the <span class="smcap">Twenty-second</span> after the Treaty of Amiens
in 1802. It served with reputation in India; was
employed at the reduction of Java; signalized
itself on several occasions; and was rewarded with
the royal authority to bear the word <em>Seringapatam</em>
on its guidons and appointments. It was disbanded
in England in 1820.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2 center"><em>Raised in 1795.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-sixth</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-General R. Manners;&mdash;numbered
the <span class="smcap">Twenty-third</span> in 1803.
This regiment served in Egypt, Portugal, Spain,
Flanders, and France; and its distinguished conduct
was rewarded with the honour of bearing
on its guidons and appointments, the <em>Sphinx</em>,
with the words <em>Egypt</em>, <em>Peninsula</em>, and <em>Waterloo</em>.
In 1816 it was constituted a corps of <span class="smcap">Lancers</span>.
It was disbanded in England in 1817.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-seventh</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Wynter
Blathwayte;&mdash;numbered the <span class="smcap">Twenty-fourth</span> in
1804. This regiment served in India, distinguished
itself at the battles of Ghur and Delhi,
and was permitted to bear the <em>Elephant</em>, with
the word <em>Hindoostan</em>, on its guidons and appointments.
It was disbanded in England, on its
arrival from Bengal, in 1819.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-eighth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Robert

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-ninth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Francis
Augustus Lord Heathfield;&mdash;numbered the
<span class="smcap">Twenty-fifth</span> in 1804. This regiment served

<p class="noindent">The accession of the house of Hanover to the
throne of Great Britain and Ireland, was the
commencement of a dynasty under which this
kingdom has attained a splendid elevation of
naval, military, commercial, and political importance;
has extended its possessions in remote
countries;&mdash;and its armies have fought and
conquered in every quarter of the globe. The
first year of His Majesty's reign had, however,
not expired, when it was found necessary to
augment the regular army, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth,
(the King's) Regiment of Light Dragoons</span>, is
one of the corps incorporated on that occasion.
It was raised in South Britain, by Brigadier-General
<span class="smcap">James Dormer</span>, who had acquired a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
reputation in the war of the Spanish succession;
and the following officers were appointed to the
regiment, by commissions dated the 22nd July,
1715.</p>

<p>His Majesty's protestant subjects arrayed themselves
under the royal standard with great cheerfulness,
but before the regiment was complete in
men and horses, the arrangements of the Jacobites
were in such a state of forwardness, that the
Pretender's standard was raised in Scotland by the
Earl of Mar, who was soon at the head of ten
thousand men. A body of rebels having penetrated
into Lancashire, <span class="smcap">Dormer's</span> dragoons were among
the corps directed to advance, under Major-General
Wills, and fight the insurgent bands: the
regiment was formed in brigade with Pitt's horse,
now second dragoon guards, under its Colonel,
Brigadier-General Dormer. Arriving at <em>Preston</em>,
about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 12th
of November, the rebels were found in force in the
town, with the avenues barricaded and defended
by cannon. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons were
directed to dismount and form as infantry, to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
part in storming the avenue leading to Lancaster,
in which they were assisted by Wynne's (ninth),
and a squadron of Stanhope's dragoons (afterwards
disbanded) under Brigadier-Generals Dormer and
Munden; Pitt's horse, Munden's (thirteenth), and
a squadron of Stanhope's dragoons forming in
support. The first barrier was carried with great
gallantry; but the inner barricade could not be
forced for want of cannon. The houses were
afterwards set on fire, and measures adopted to
prevent the escape of the rebels, who were
eventually forced to surrender at discretion. The
regiment had three men and sixteen horses killed
on this occasion, Brigadier-General Dormer, and
four private soldiers wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment escorted a number of the captured
insurgents to Lancaster gaol, and was afterwards
quartered in that town, and in the early part of
1716 the rebellion was suppressed by the troops
under the Duke of Argyle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>In May 1716, the regiment marched from
Lancaster, into cantonments at Lincoln and the
neighbouring towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1717</div>

<p>A reduction of the army took place in the
spring of 1717, and in May, <span class="smcap">Dormer's</span> dragoons
marched to Bristol and embarked for Ireland, to
replace a regiment ordered to be disbanded in that
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1720</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Ireland during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
succeeding twenty-five years. In 1720, Brigadier-General
Dormer was removed to the sixth regiment
of foot, and was succeeded in the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons, by Colonel Clement
Neville, from the lieut.-colonelcy of the thirteenth
dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1721<br />1737</div>

<p>Colonel Neville commanded the regiment
seventeen years, and was removed in 1737, to the
eighth dragoons, and the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
was conferred on Colonel Archibald
Hamilton from the 27th foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740<br />1741<br />1742</div>

<p>Charles VI. Emperor of Germany, died in
1740; the succession of the Archduchess Maria-Theresa,
as Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, was
disputed by the Elector of Bavaria, who was
supported by a French army; and, in 1742, King
George II. sent a British force to Flanders to aid
the house of Austria; at the same time the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons were withdrawn from
Ireland, to replace the cavalry regiments which
had proceeded on foreign service from England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743<br />1744<br />1745</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed in Great Britain
during the years 1743 and 1744; and in 1745,
when Charles Edward, eldest son of the Pretender,
raised his father's standard in Scotland, it was
ordered to Stirling. After Lieut.-General Sir John
Cope had marched from Stirling with the infantry
and some artillery, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons
proceeded to Leith, where they were stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
when the rebel army advanced towards Edinburgh.
They were suddenly ordered to join
Colonel Gardiner, who was retiring before the
rebel army, with the thirteenth dragoons; they
rode through Edinburgh at a brisk pace during
public worship on Sunday, the 15th of September,
when the congregations rushed out of the churches
and chapels and filled the streets, and four
hundred volunteers, with a thousand men of
the trained bands, appeared in arms. The
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons joined Colonel Gardiner
at Carstorphin, from whence they fell back to
Coltsbridge, where they were joined by the
city guard and Edinburgh regiment. On a
report of the approach of the rebel bands, the
Edinburgh regiment and city guard withdrew
within the walls, and the dragoons moved towards
Haddington, the citizens refusing to admit them
into the place; and while a tumultuary council
was being held to decide about the mode of defending
the city, the insurgents gained possession
of one of the gates: thus Edinburgh fell into the
hands of the young Pretender.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons were afterwards
ordered to join Lieut.-General Sir John Cope,
who had arrived at Dunbar with a small body
of infantry, and he advanced towards Edinburgh,
when the rebel army was put in motion to meet
him. On the 20th of September the King's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
troops confronted the insurgents near <em>Prestonpans</em>
and the night was passed in the field:
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
William Wright, furnished videttes and
patrols on the flanks of the army. Before day-break,
on the following morning, a chosen band
of Highlanders advanced through the thick
atmosphere, and attacked the right of the King's
troops; their sudden advance in the dark, their
superior numbers, and peculiar mode of fighting,
struck with consternation the few men who
guarded the artillery, and who faced about and
fled. The dragoons advanced to charge the
Highlanders; but seeing the very superior numbers
of their opponents, and being discouraged by
the loss of their artillery, they made only a feeble
effort to stem the torrent of battle, and afterwards
retired from the field. Several officers, and a
few private soldiers, however, behaved with great
gallantry, and among others, Major <span class="smcap">Richard
Bowles</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons, particularly
distinguished himself; the few troopers,
who rallied round him, had been cut down, and
his own horse killed; but he continued to fight
on foot; he was surrounded, and had received
eleven wounds, when a rebel leader interposed
and saved his life. When once troops are put
into confusion, and are afterwards closely pressed
by the enemy, no reserves being at hand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
them to rally upon, the difficulty of restoring
order becomes particularly great, and, in this
instance, the loss of the battle was the result.
The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons withdrew from the
field, and afterwards marched to Berwick.</p>

<p>The regiment subsequently joined the army
assembled under Field-Marshal Wade at Newcastle;
when the rebels penetrated into Derbyshire,
it was employed in covering Yorkshire;
and when the young Pretender made a precipitate
retreat to Scotland, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons
marched to Edinburgh, where a few regiments
were assembled under Lieut.-General Hawley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>On their return to Scotland, the rebels besieged
Stirling Castle; and Lieut.-General Hawley
put the King's troops in motion to raise the
siege. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons left Edinburgh
on the 13th of January, 1746; they took
part in driving a body of rebels out of Linlithgow,
and were subsequently encamped near <em>Falkirk</em>.</p>

<p>On the 17th of January, as the soldiers were
at dinner in the camp, the approach of the rebel
army was descried, and the troops moved towards
some high grounds on Falkirk-moor, where the
insurgent bands were formed. The action was
commenced by a charge of the cavalry; the
enemy's first line was broken, and some execution
done; but the second line of insurgents repulsed
the dragoons. The infantry was, soon afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
brought into the fight; but a heavy storm of
wind and rain beat so violently in the soldiers'
faces, as nearly to blind them, and the wet prevented
their muskets giving fire. Several regiments
retired in some disorder; others maintained
their ground and repulsed the Highlanders,
and after dark the whole withdrew to Linlithgow
and afterwards to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland subsequently took
the command of the troops in Scotland, and advanced
towards Stirling; when the rebels made a
precipitate retreat. His Royal Highness pursued;
but the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons were left behind,
and were directed to patrol along the roads leading
westward from Edinburgh, to prevent the
rebels obtaining intelligence. At length the Highlanders
were overpowered in the field of Culloden,
and the rebellion was suppressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>In 1747 the regiment returned to Ireland, and
was stationed in that country during the succeeding
forty-eight years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Hamilton died on the 8th of
July, 1749, and King George II. conferred the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons on Lieut.-General
James, Lord Tyrawley, from the tenth
regiment of Foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>The following description of the clothing and
guidons of the regiment is taken from the Royal
Warrant, dated the 1st of July, 1751.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1752</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Lord Tyrawley commanded the
regiment two years, and was removed, in July,
1752, to the third dragoons, and was succeeded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Colonel Lewis Dejean, whose regiment of foot
had been disbanded at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 1748&ndash;9.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756<br />1757</div>

<p>Colonel Dejean was promoted to the rank of
major-general in 1756, and in 1757 he was removed
to the third Irish Horse, now sixth dragoon
guards; and His Majesty conferred the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons on Colonel John
Campbell, from the fifty-fourth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '1751 1769 1765'">1759<br />1761<br />1765</ins></div>

<p>The rank of major-general was conferred on
Colonel Campbell in 1759; in 1761 his uncle,
Archibald, third Duke of Argyle, died, when his
father, General John Campbell of the Scots Greys,
succeeded to that title, and Major-General Campbell
of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> Dragoons obtained the
designation of <span class="smcap">Marquis of Lorne</span>: he was removed
to the first, the royal regiment of foot, in
1765, and was succeeded in the command of the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons, by Colonel Charles Fitzroy,
(afterwards Lord Southampton) whose regiment
of foot had been disbanded at the peace of
Fontainbleau in 1763.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>On the 19th December, 1768, a warrant was
issued, by authority of King George III., for
regulating the standards, guidons, clothing, &amp;c.,
of the regiments of cavalry, in which it was
directed, that the uniform of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
dragoons should be red, with <em>lemon-coloured</em>
facings, without lappels, with silver lace; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
uniform, &amp;c., being the same as prescribed by
the Royal Warrant of the 1st July, 1751.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772</div>

<p>Colonel Fitzroy was promoted to the rank of
major-general and removed to the third dragoons,
in 1772, when King George III. conferred the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons on Lieut.-General
Daniel Webb, from the eighth foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1773</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Webb died in 1773, and was
succeeded by Colonel George Warde, from the
lieut.-colonelcy of the fourth dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775<br />1776<br />1777</div>

<p>Hostilities between Great Britain and her
North American Colonies commenced in 1775,
and the rugged valleys and trackless forests which
became the theatre of this war, were not adapted
for the operations of heavy dragoons. The necessity
of having a greater proportion of light
cavalry had become apparent, and in 1776, the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, which were then in Ireland, were
constituted a corps of <span class="smcap">Light Dragoons</span>. The
standard height for men and horses was reduced;
the cocked hats were replaced by helmets; arms
and appointments of a lighter description were
adopted, and in the annual army list for 1777,
the regiment was designated, "<span class="smcap">The Fourteenth
Light Dragoons</span>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>In 1778, Major-General Warde was removed to
the first Irish horse, now fourth dragoon guards, and
was succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons, by Major-General Robert Sloper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>In 1784 the clothing of the light dragoon
regiments was changed from scarlet to <em>dark blue</em>;
and the following orders were issued on this subject,
dated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><em>Adjutant General's Office,<br />
Dublin, 18th May, 1784.</em></p>

<p>'His Majesty's pleasure having been signified
to the Lord Lieutenant, that the clothing of the

made in conformity to the following regulations,
it is the Commander-in-Chief's order that the

<p class="p1 center"><em>Regulations for the Clothing of the Light Dragoons.</em></p>

<p>The clothing of a private light dragoon is to
consist of a jacket, shell, under-waistcoat, and
leather breeches.</p>

<p>The jacket and shell to be of <em>blue</em> cloth; the
collars and cuffs of the royal regiments to be red,
and those of the other regiments to be of the

<p>The foregoing orders were sent to the officers
commanding the 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 17th, and

<div class="sidenote">1791<br />1793</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Ireland performing
the usual duties of a cavalry corps on home service,
until the events attendant on the French
revolution occasioned it to be employed in continental
and colonial warfare. When this revolution
assumed its wild and violent character, the
spirit of republicanism soon extended to the
French West India Islands. The resolution to
grant the immediate freedom of the slaves, for
which they were unprepared, was followed, in 1791,
by acts of outrage and spoliation committed by
the blacks against the properties of their owners.
In 1793 the planters of St. Domingo obtained
British aid; and the revolutionists afterwards
received assistance from France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794<br />1795</div>

<p>In the same year, a British army appeared in
Flanders under the Duke of York, to arrest the
progress of the French aggressions on the continent;
and in 1794, two troops of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons were withdrawn from Ireland to
engage in the contest. On their arrival in Flanders,
the two troops of the regiment were attached
to the eighth light dragoons; and they formed
part of the van of the forces under Lieut.-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Earl of Moira, on the march from Ostend to
join the army under His Royal Highness the
Duke of York. The squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
also shared in the toils and hardships of the winter
campaign in Holland; it took part in several
skirmishes with the enemy, and after enduring
great privation and suffering from an unusually
severe season, which occasioned the loss of several
men and horses, it arrived in the early part of
1795, in Germany, where it was incorporated in
the eighth regiment of light dragoons.</p>

<p>The contest in the West Indies had, in the
meantime, been carried on with varied success,
and the seven troops of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light
dragoons in Ireland were ordered to give up their
horses to the twenty-fourth light dragoons at
Clonmel, and to embark for the West Indies dismounted.
This transfer took place under the
direction of Major-General Egerton, who bore
testimony to the alacrity with which the officers
and men prepared for embarkation.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked on the 25th of February,
1795, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Arthur Carter; on arriving at <em>St. Domingo</em>, it
was furnished with such horses as could be procured,
and it was soon engaged in active operations
against the bands of armed negroes and mulattoes
who had enrolled themselves under the banners
of the French republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796<br />1797</div>

<p>During the years 1796 and 1797, numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
actions occurred; but against a hundred thousand
trained blacks who had been instructed in European
discipline, the few British troops on the
island were unable to do more than exhibit many
brilliant examples of discipline and valour. In
an enterprise against the post of <em>Mirebalais</em> in
the beginning of June, 1797, a detachment of
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, Eighteenth, and Twenty-first
light dragoons, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Carter of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, distinguished themselves.
They drove twelve hundred of the enemy
with three pieces of cannon from a strong position,
captured two guns, and chased a number of opponents
into the river Artibonite, capturing
their ammunition, mules, &amp;c. The conduct of
Lieut.-Colonel Carter, and of the dragoons under
his orders, was commended in the public despatches.
The climate of St. Domingo was,
however, so very injurious to the health of European
soldiers, that the regiment was soon
reduced to a skeleton. The few surviving men
who were fit for service, were permitted to volunteer
into other corps, and the remainder, twenty-five
in number, embarked for England, where
they arrived in the month of October, and were
stationed at Chelmsford.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1797, General Sir Robert
Sloper. K.B., was removed to the fourth dragoons,
and the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> was conferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on Major-General John William Egerton,
afterwards Earl of Bridgewater, from first lieut.-colonel
of the seventh light dragoons. This
officer being on the staff when the few men of the
regiment arrived from St. Domingo, he was employed
in superintending the recruiting and remounting
of his corps, and in a short time he
had the satisfaction of seeing it a fine body of
light cavalry mustering six hundred mounted
men, who were divided into eight troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>In August, 1798, King George III. was
graciously pleased to approve of the regiment
being styled "the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Duchess
of York's own</span> Regiment of Light Dragoons," in
honour of Frederica Charlotte Ulrica Catherina,
Princess Royal of Prussia, who was married to His
Royal Highness the Duke of York in 1791; at the
same time the Royal authority was given for the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> to assume the "<span class="smcap">Prussian Eagle</span>"
as a regimental badge, and the colour of the
facing of the regiment was changed from lemon-yellow
to <em>orange</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800<br />1802</div>

<p>The establishment was augmented to ten
troops, of ninety rank and file each, in 1800;
but at the peace of Amiens, in 1802, a reduction
of two troops took place.</p>

<p>Hostilities were resumed in 1803, and in 1804
the regiment was again augmented to ten troops
of ninety rank and file each, for which a supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>of new carbines and pistols was received in 1807,
from the ordnance stores.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>The French Emperor, Napoleon Buonaparte,
having attempted to reduce Spain and Portugal
to subjection to his power, a British army proceeded
to Portugal to aid the inhabitants in their
struggles for freedom. Portugal had been delivered,
and the army under Lieutenant-General
Sir John Moore was advancing into Spain, when
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> (the <span class="smcap">Duchess of York's Own</span>)
regiment of light dragoons, was ordered to embark
for the Peninsula. The regiment marched
to Falmouth, where it was put on board of transports,
and arrived at Lisbon on the 23rd of
December under the command of Colonel Samuel
Hawker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The return to England of the troops which had
served under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore,
whose career of honour was terminated at the
battle of Corunna, left only a small British
force in the Peninsula, and these troops
were quartered near Lisbon, from whence the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons advanced in the
early part of 1809, to Bucellas, an out-post of the
army. In April the regiment formed the advance-guard
on the march of the army to Coimbra,
and in the beginning of May it was united
in brigade with the sixteenth and twentieth light
dragoons under Major-General Cotton, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
reviewed on the plains of Coimbra by Lieutenant-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley. The French
troops under Marshals Soult and Victor had, in
the meantime, invaded Portugal, and Marshal
Soult had captured Oporto.</p>

<p>To expel the French from <em>Oporto</em>, was the
first service undertaken by the British commander;
on this occasion two squadrons of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>,
under Lieut.-Colonel Neil Talbot, were detached
with the Portuguese troops under Marshal
Beresford to intercept the French, if they should
attempt to retreat by Amarante; the remaining
three squadrons under Colonel Hawker advanced
direct upon Oporto, and being employed, with
the other cavalry on the advance-piquets, they
took part in the rencounters with the enemy on
the 10th and 11th of May. Arriving on the 12th
of May, on the banks of the Douro near Oporto,
unperceived by the French, the English general
resolved to pass the river, when two squadrons of
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were detached, with the German
brigade and two guns under Major-General
John Murray, three miles up the river, to Barca
de Avintas, where they effected a passage in
boats. In the meantime a portion of the army
had passed nearer the city, and was engaged in a
fierce action with the enemy, when the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons and the Germans were
seen advancing down the right bank of the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
The French made a precipitate retreat. The
leading squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, commanded
by Major F. B. Hervey, and gallantly supported
by the second squadron under Major the
Honourable Charles Butler, dashed sword in hand
upon the enemy's rear-guard and overthrew it,
as it was pushing through a narrow road to
gain an open space beyond the defile. Some execution
was done, the French General, Laborde,
was unhorsed, and General Foy was wounded;
but no other troops advancing to support the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, the gallant dragoons had to fight
their way back, and had several men and horses
killed and wounded. Major F. B. Hervey lost
his right arm; Captain Peter Hawker, Lieutenants
Robert Knipe, and Evelyn P. Dormer, were
wounded.</p>

<p>The conduct of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> was commended
in Sir Arthur Wellesley's public despatch,
and also in general orders. They had marched
eighty miles in four days over the most difficult
country, and they were employed in pursuing,
along a mountainous region, the discomfited French
troops, whose line of retreat could be traced by the
smoke of burning houses. Having followed the
enemy as far as Ginjo, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light
dragoons halted, and afterwards moved towards
Abrantes, where the army was concentrated for
operations on the Tagus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>From Abrantes the army advanced into Spain,
and a body of French troops under Marshal
Victor retreated from Talavera de la Reyna.
The Spaniards under General Cuesta pursued
with avidity; but the French were reinforced,
and they drove the Spaniards back upon <em>Talavera</em>,
where the allied army formed in order of battle;
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons being posted in
the rear of Brigadier-General Alexander Campbell's
division.</p>

<p>When the army went into position, Major-General
Mackenzie was left with a division of
infantry and a brigade of cavalry, as an advanced
post, in the wood on the right of the Alberche,
which covered the left flank. The French attacked
this post between two and three o'clock
on the 27th of July, when the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light
dragoons were ordered forward, and they crossed
the Alberche river, and sent out a line of skirmishers
to cover the retrograde movements of the
infantry. The regiment was employed in skirmishing
until night, and had nine horses killed;
Lieutenant Theophilus Thomas Ellis, and one
private soldier wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons resumed their
post in the position occupied by the allied army,
and supported the infantry during the severe contest
on the 28th of July. The left of the British
line was attacked at day-break, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
enemy was repulsed at this point, a long pause
ensued. An attack on the centre was made soon
after two o'clock, and the French were again
driven back; they also failed in another attack
on the left. A strong body of the enemy advanced
against Major-General Sherbrooke's division;
this attack was repulsed by a charge of the
whole division with bayonets; but the brigade of
foot guards pursued so far as to be in danger of
being annihilated; when the forty-eighth regiment,
and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> and sixteenth light dragoons
were brought forward, and the foot guards rallied
and again advanced. This was a moment of
great peril to the allied army; but the steady
valour of the British troops prevailed, and the
French fell back.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons had three
men and twenty-one horses killed; Colonel Samuel
Hawker, Captains John Chapman, and Peter
Hawker, Lieutenants William Wainman and
Thomas Smith, six rank and file, and three
horses wounded; thirteen horses missing; Lieutenant
Evelyn P. Dormer taken prisoner. Lieutenant-Colonel
Neil Talbot, and Major Baker
had each a horse killed under him.</p>

<p>Colonel Hawker was rewarded with a gold
medal, and the regiment was subsequently
authorised to bear on its guidons and appointments
the word "<span class="smcap">Talavera</span>", in commemoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of its distinguished services in this
action.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>After this battle the enemy brought forward
such very superior numbers, that the British
General was forced to act on the defensive, and
while the army was encamped on the banks of
the Guadiana, a malignant fever proved fatal to
numbers of officers and soldiers. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
dragoons were removed to Villa Vicosa,
a fortified town in the Alemtejo, from whence
they marched, in December, to Santarem, a town
very pleasantly situated on the right bank of the
Tagus, where they were formed in brigade with
the royal dragoons under Major-General Slade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>In February, 1810, Badajoz and Ciudad Rodrigo
were both menaced by the enemy, and in March
the regiment returned to the Alemtejo, and took
the advanced posts of Lieut.-General Rowland
Hill's corps at Arronches, a town situate at the
conflux of the Caya and the Algrette, near the
Spanish frontiers. A concentration of French
troops near Ciudad Rodrigo afterwards relieved
the other provinces. Ciudad Rodrigo was eventually
beseiged by Marshal Ney, and the British
commander, hoping the enemy, by detaching
troops, would furnish an opportunity for relieving
this fortress, withdrew the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
dragoons from the Alemtejo. The regiment
advanced to Almeida in June; it was attached to
the light division under Brigadier-General Craufurd,
who was behind the Agueda river, watching
the enemy's motions; and with the sixteenth
light dragoons, and first hussars King's German
Legion, took the out-post duty on this frontier.</p>

<p>No opportunity to relieve Ciudad Rodrigo occurred;
but during the siege marauding parties
of French soldiers entered the villages of Barquillo
and <em>Villa de Puerco</em> on three successive nights.
Brigadier-General Craufurd, thinking to cut off
the next party, formed two ambuscades, one near
Villa de Puerco, with six squadrons, another of
three squadrons near Barquillo, and he also placed
his artillery, five companies of the ninety-fifth,
(Rifle-brigade) and the third Portuguese Caçadores
in reserve; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons were
employed in these ambuscades. On the morning
of the 11th of July, a little after day-break, a
party of French infantry was observed near Villa
de Puerco, and a small body of cavalry at Barquillo;
and the open country on the right would
have enabled the six squadrons to place themselves
between the infantry and their point of retreat;
but this was circuitous, and Brigadier-General
Craufurd preferred passing along a narrow defile
between two stone walls. This proved difficult;
in threading the defile in a long line the dragoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were separated, and the French infantry, two
hundred strong, had time to form square, being
hidden in high standing corn. The French dragoons
coming out of Barquillo, were charged by
the German hussars and a squadron of the sixteenth,
and two officers and twenty-nine men were
made prisoners. In the meantime the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons had threaded the defile,
and mounting the hill, rode with distinguished
gallantry against the square; but the French
infantry remained perfectly steady, and opened
such a fire, that Lieut.-Colonel Talbot and eight
men fell dead close to the bayonets, and twenty-three
men were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The survivors withdrew
a short distance to reform their ranks, and
the French square commenced its retreat with
singular steadiness and good order. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
dragoons seeing this, prepared to launch
against it another squadron, which was already in
speed for the purpose, when Colonel Arentschildt
of the hussars, observing cavalry approaching in
front and flank, checked the movement. It was
afterwards regretted that he took this step, as the
horsemen, who alarmed him, proved to be the
German hussars and sixteenth returning from the
pursuit of the French dragoons, the whole of
whom they had captured.</p>

<p>On the death of Lieut.-Colonel Talbot the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the regiment devolved on Lieut.-Colonel
F. B. Hervey, under whose directions the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
became celebrated as an efficient corps of
light cavalry, remarkable for the excellent manner
in which they performed the out-post duty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ciudad Rodrigo had surrendered;
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> remained in the villages near
Fort La Conception until the 21st of July, when
the enemy's masses approaching, they fell back
to <em>Almeida</em>, where Brigadier-General Craufurd
halted the few troops under his orders, and, with
astonishing hardihood, confronted the whole
French army. During the night of the 23rd of
July, the videttes and patrols of the regiment were
exposed to a heavy storm of wind and rain, and as
daylight appeared, they discovered the approach
of numerous legions of the enemy: a few shots
were fired; the cavalry reserves and guns moved
forward, and a skirmish ensued in which the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> had one serjeant killed; Lieutenant
John Blachford, one private soldier, and four
horses wounded. After opposing the superior
numbers of the enemy for some time, the British
withdrew beyond the river Coa; and Brigadier-General
Craufurd stated in his despatch,&mdash;'The
retreat of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons from
Val-de-la-Mula to Almeida, was conducted in
the most regular and soldier-like manner, though
opposed to a superior force of French cavalry.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A squadron of the regiment and a squadron of
the royal dragoons, on duty at <em>Frexadas</em>, were
sharply engaged with a superior force of the
enemy on the 28th of August, and highly distinguished
themselves.</p>

<p>Marshal Massena invaded Portugal with such
an immense superiority of numbers, that the
British commander was under the necessity of
withdrawing from the frontiers, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
and sixteenth light dragoons, with the
first German hussars, had the honour of covering
the retrograde movements. On the 24th of September
the enemy skirmished with the piquets in
front of <em>Mortagao</em>, from whence a squadron of the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> under Captain Thomas W. Brotherton,
with one of the sixteenth and first hussars,
covered the retreat of the light division four miles
to some strong ground. The three squadrons repulsed
four of French hussars; some of the enemy's
dragoons approaching too close, were charged by
the squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, and overthrown
with the loss of about thirty men. On the following
morning the cavalry skirmishers exchanged a
few shots, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were employed in
covering the retreat of the light division to the
position of Busaco. During this retreat Captain
the Hon. Henry Percy was taken prisoner while
reconnoitring the flank movement of the enemy.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were in reserve during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
battle of <em>Busaco</em> on the 27th of September; and
they were subsequently employed in covering the
retreat of the army to the strong lines of Torres
Vedras.</p>

<p>On the 1st of October, the out-posts were attacked
and driven from the hills bounding the
plain of <em>Coimbra</em> to the north, when three troops
of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, under Major the Honourable
Charles Butler, proceeded through the town, and
formed the rear-guard on the main road from
Coimbra to Pombal. The remainder of the
regiment was formed on the plain, with the
other cavalry corps, and withdrew before a superior
force of the enemy, crossing the Mondego
at a ford below the town, and skirmishing to
prevent the passage of the river by the enemy.</p>

<p>The French army continuing to press forward,
its advance-guard skirmished with the rear of the
allies almost every day, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons had frequent opportunities of exhibiting
brilliant instances of the innate valour of
British soldiers. At <em>Rio Mandevilla</em> the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
and sixteenth light dragoons, first German
hussars, royal dragoons, and Captain Bull's
troop of artillery, repulsed a very superior force
of the enemy, on which occasion the first French
hussars were nearly annihilated. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
had six men and six horses killed; eight
men and twelve horses wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The French legions continued to press forward
as to an assured victory; but the lines of Torres
Vedras arrested their progress, and while they remained
in front of these extensive works, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons took the line of out-posts
from the Sobral road. The French army withdrew
during the night of the 14th of November;
the morning of the 15th was foggy, and it was
some hours after day-break when the British
General discovered the void space in his front.
The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were ordered forward along the
Cartaxo road, and their patrols took a number
of French stragglers prisoners. Marshal Massena
took up a position at Santarem; the head quarters
of the allied army were established at Cartaxo,
and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons furnished
the out-posts, extending from the causeway and
bridge over the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>After wasting his army by privation and sickness,
the French marshal retreated; and at day-light
on the 6th of March, 1811, Lord Wellington
discovered the empty camps at Santarem, and
moved his own army forward in pursuit. On
the 8th of March, a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
commanded by Captain Babington, and supported
by the other squadrons of the regiment under
Colonel Hervey, made a successful charge on
four squadrons of the eleventh and twenty-sixth
French dragoons at <em>Venta de Serra</em>, and captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fourteen men and fourteen horses; with the loss
of two men and two horses.</p>

<p>Continuing to press upon the rear of the French
army, the regiment was present at the skirmish
at <em>Pombal</em> on the 10th of March, at <em>Redinha</em> on
the 12th, at <em>Casal Nova</em> on the 14th, and at <em>Foz
d'Aronce</em> on the 15th. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were
also present at the action near <em>Sabugal</em>, on the
3rd April, but did not sustain any loss.</p>

<p>The French Commander continued his retreat
to Salamanca, and the British General stood victorious
on the confines of Portugal; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons furnished the out-posts
on the left bank of the Agueda at Villa del Egua,
where a peasant arrived from Ledesma, with
intelligence that the French army was reinforced
and re-organized, and was advancing. A squadron
under Captain Brotherton was sent to Santa
Espirita, and it fell back behind the Agueda as the
French army advanced.</p>

<p>Almeida being blockaded by the allied army,
Marshal Massena advanced to its relief; the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> withdrew gradually as the enemy
approached, and on the 3rd of May they were
engaged behind <em>Gallegos</em>; when Lieutenant John
Townsend retired with the piquets under a heavy
cannonade towards Fuentes d'Onor, and a squadron,
under Captain Brotherton, had a sharp affair
near Pozo Velho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>At the battle of <em>Fuentes d'Onor</em>, on the 5th
of May, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> and first royal dragoons
covered the movement of the right of the army
from Nave d'Aver, retiring by alternate squadrons,
under a heavy cannonade; one squadron
of the regiment charged with signal gallantry
some French artillery, but was repulsed, and
Captain Robert Knipe commanding the squadron
was mortally wounded: he was succeeded in the
command of the squadron by Lieutenant (afterwards
Lieut.-Colonel) John Townsend: Lieut.-Colonel
Hervey had his horse killed under him,
and received a severe contusion.</p>

<p>An attack was made on the position in the rear
of the village. 'The French with one shock
drove in all the cavalry out-guards, and cutting
off Captain Ramsay's battery, came sweeping in
upon the reserves of horse and upon the seventh
division. But their leading squadrons approaching
in a disorderly manner, were partially
checked by the British, and, at the same time,
a great commotion was observed in their main
body. Men and horses there closed with confusion
and tumult towards one point, a thick
dust arose, and loud cries, and the sparkling of
blades, and the flashing of pistols, indicated some
extraordinary occurrence. Suddenly the multitude
became violently agitated, an English
shout pealed high and clear, the mass was rent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
asunder, and Norman Ramsay burst forth at
the head of his battery, his horses, breathing fire,
stretched like greyhounds along the plain, the
guns bounding behind them as things of no
weight, and the mounted gunners followed in
full career. Captain Brotherton of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
dragoons, seeing this, rode forth with a
squadron and overturned the head of the pursuing
troops, and General Charles Stewart joining
in the charge, took the French General
Lamotte, fighting hand to hand.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The French
were repulsed in their attempt to relieve Almeida,
and they withdrew from Portugal.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons had Captain
Robert Knipe and three private soldiers killed;
Captain Thomas Potter Milles, Lieutenants John
Townsend, John Gwynne, Lovell B. Badcock,
Theophilus Thomas Ellis, six serjeants, and
twenty-one rank and file wounded; three private
soldiers missing. Lieut.-Colonel Hervey was
rewarded with a gold medal, and the royal authority
was subsequently given for the regiment
to bear on its guidons and appointments the
words "<span class="smcap">Fuentes d'Onor</span>," as a special mark
of His Majesty's approbation of its conduct on
this occasion.</p>

<p>Viscount Wellington subsequently proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to Estremadura, where the strong fortress of Badajoz
was besieged by the allies, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
dragoons formed part of the force left on
the Agueda. Marshal Marmont advanced with
a numerous French army, and having introduced
a convoy into Ciudad Rodrigo, he drove back the
British posts. On the morning of the 6th of
June, two French columns appeared, when the
light division was directed to retire from Gallegos
upon <em>Nave d'Aver</em> and subsequently upon Alfayetes,
and the royal dragoons, with a squadron
of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, covered the retreat. Two
thousand French cavalry, six thousand infantry,
and ten guns, bore down upon the British squadrons
and menaced their destruction; but the
French horsemen were attacked and defeated
twice, and the retreat was effected with little
loss.</p>

<p>Marshal Marmont afterwards marched to
Spanish Estremadura, and the British General
withdrew from before Badajoz. The allied army
subsequently proceeded to the vicinity of Ciudad
Rodrigo, and eventually blockaded that fortress,
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> taking part in the out-post
duty as usual. When the French army advanced
to relieve the blockade, the regiment was stationed
at Espejo, on the lower Azava, with advanced-posts
at <em>Carpio</em> and Marialva. Having thrown
a supply into Ciudad Rodrigo, the French Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
marched against the allied army, and on
the morning of the 25th of September, fourteen
squadrons of the imperial guards drove the out-posts
from Carpio, across the Azava; the lancers
of Berg crossed the river in pursuit, but were
charged and driven back by a squadron of the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> and two squadrons of the sixteenth
light dragoons, and Carpio was again occupied
by the British. Another body of the enemy
attacked the troops at El Bodon, and when the
British had withdrawn from this post, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
fell back from Carpio, and a succession
of retrograde movements followed, until the allied
army took up a position behind Soita, when the
French withdrew into Spain.</p>

<p>In the action at Carpio, and in the subsequent
movements, the regiment had Lieutenant Hall
and several private soldiers wounded; and the
conduct of its commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel
Hervey, was commended in the public despatches;
the excellent behaviour of Captain Brotherton
was also particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>During the winter the strength of the regiment
on foreign service was reduced two troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>Ciudad Rodrigo was captured in January, 1812;
the regiment subsequently proceeded to Spanish
Estremadura, and was stationed near <em>Badajoz</em>
when the siege of that fortress was undertaken.
The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> subsequently joined that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
portion of the covering army which was under
Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham, and when
the French army under Marshal Soult advanced,
the British fell back upon Albuhera; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
were employed in covering the retrograde
movement, and they skirmished with the enemy's
advanced-guard near <em>Villa Franca</em>. Badajoz
having been captured by storm during the night
of the 5th of April, the French army marching
to its relief fell back.</p>

<p>In a few days after the capture of Badajoz, the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were engaged in an enterprise
against several regiments of French cavalry.
The Regiment moved, on the night of the 10th
of April, from Villa Franca upon Usagre, and
afterwards along the Road to <em>Llerena</em>; the light
brigade skirmished with the French, until the
heavy brigade turned their flank; the enemy
was then charged, overthrown, pursued, and many
prisoners taken. On the following night a party
of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, under Lieutenant Edward
Pellew, took a piquet of twenty-two French dragoons
prisoners. The regiment had upwards of
twenty men and several horses wounded; and the
conduct of Lieut.-Colonel Hervey was commended
in Lieut.-General Sir Stapleton Cotton's despatch.</p>

<p>From Estremadura, the regiment marched
towards the Agueda, and it formed the advanced
guard of Sir Thomas Graham's column in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
march towards <em>Salamanca</em>, near which city it
skirmished with a body of the enemy on the 16th
of June, and had one serjeant and one trumpeter
killed; four private soldiers and five horses
wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy retired behind the Douro, and the
allies followed to the banks of that river, where
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were formed in brigade with the
first German hussars, and took the out-posts at
Tordesillas. In the middle of July, Marshal
Marmont commenced offensive operations and
passed the Douro at several points, when Lord
Wellington united his centre and left behind the
Guarena stream, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> and German
hussars covered the retreat from Rueda.
The right wing of the allied army and a brigade
of cavalry were at Castrejon on the Trabancas,
and to cover the retrograde of this force, the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> and German hussars moved, on the
17th of July, to Alaejos. On the 18th some
sharp skirmishing occurred, and the troops at
Castrejon fell back behind the Guarena; the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> retired from the plain near Alaejos
under a heavy fire, and took post behind the
Guarena at <em>Castrillos</em>. The French army advanced
to the opposite side of the river, and General
Clausel, sent a brigade of cavalry across under
Brigadier-General Carier, supporting it with a
column of infantry, and manifesting an intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to press the British left. Major-General Victor
<em>Baron</em> Alten led the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> and first
German hussars against the French cavalry, and
some sharp fighting occurred, during which
General Carier was made prisoner. While the
British and French horsemen were warmly
engaged, the twenty-seventh and fortieth regiments,
supported by a Portuguese brigade, came rushing
down the hill and broke the French infantry with
an impetuous bayonet charge; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
and German hussars had, in the meantime,
driven back the French cavalry, and the two
regiments charged the broken infantry, and
sabred some, and made others prisoners. The
regiment had eighteen men and twenty horses
killed; Captain Brotherton, Lieutenants John
Gwynne, Francis Fowke, thirty-four rank and
file, and eighteen horses wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment was actively employed in the
operations of the succeeding three days, and
occasionally skirmished between the opposing
armies.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of July the memorable battle of
<em>Salamanca</em> was fought; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> skirmished
with the enemy's advanced posts at day-break,
and afterwards took their station in the
line. By several changes of position, the French
Marshal endeavoured to turn the right of the allied
army and gain the road to Ciudad Rodrigo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Lord Wellington detected a false movement in the
opposing army, and instantly ordering his
divisions forward, commenced the battle. The
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons participated with the
third division in its attack upon, and complete
discomfiture of, the enemy's left; two squadrons
under Lieut.-Colonel Hervey reinforced Brigadier-General
D'Urban's Portuguese brigade, which
turned the enemy's flank, and the regiment shared
in the glorious struggle by which the French army
was overthrown and driven from the field with a
severe loss.</p>

<p>The regiment had several men and horses killed
and wounded; Captain Brotherton, though still
suffering from his wound received on the 18th of
July, mounted his charger during the fight, and
was again wounded; and the gallant bearing of
the regiment was afterwards rewarded with the
royal authority to display the word "<span class="smcap">Salamanca</span>"
on its guidons and appointments; its commanding
officer, Lieut.-Colonel Hervey, was presented with
a gold medal as a mark of royal favour and
approbation.</p>

<p>On the following day the regiment pursued the
rear of the French army, and two squadrons were
sharply engaged and took several prisoners near
<em>Penerada</em>. On the 26th, a patrol of three
dragoons of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, and four of the
German hussars, under Corporal William Hanley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the former corps, detached to <em>Blasco Sancho</em>,
captured a party of the enemy, consisting of two
officers, one serjeant, one corporal, and twenty-seven
mounted dragoons, with one private servant
and two mules, for which they received the expressions
of the approbation of the Commander of
the Forces. The French horses were given to the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> and German hussars, to complete
deficiencies; the amount was divided among the
patrol, and a further pecuniary donation was
afterwards made to the men engaged in this
gallant exploit.</p>

<p>After driving the enemy across the Douro and
taking possession of Valladolid, the army marched
to Madrid, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons
passed Segovia and bivouacked near Escurial,
a place celebrated for its magnificent palace, built
by Philip II. and used as a monastery. The head
quarters of the regiment were established at Getafe,
and it took the out-post duty. Lieutenant Cust
commanded a post of observation at Consingia,
in La Mancha, and Lieutenant Ward a post of
communication between that station and Madrid.</p>

<p>When the Marquis of Wellington left Madrid
to undertake the siege of Burgos, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
were left in the vicinity of the capital of Spain;
and when a concentration of the French forces
rendered a retrograde movement necessary, the
regiment assembled, with the first German hussars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
at Guadalaxara, and fell back upon Madrid.
From Madrid the regiment formed part of the
rear-guard of Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill's
corps, to Alba de Tormes, and for several days it
was almost constantly engaged in manœuvring
and skirmishing to retard the advance of the
enemy. On the 16th of November the regiment
repulsed the charge of a body of French lancers of
superior numbers, at <em>Matilla</em>, and had several
men killed and wounded. Colonel Hervey again
signalized himself, and narrowly escaped being
made prisoner.</p>

<p>In the retreat from Salamanca to Ciudad
Rodrigo, the regiment took part in the piquets and
other duties of the rear-guard, which it continued
to perform until the army went into cantonments
behind the Agueda; and Captain Badcock was
detached with a reconnoitring party to the Sierra
de Francia and river Alagon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>After passing the winter in cantonments among
the Portuguese peasantry, the regiment crossed
the confines of that kingdom, and formed part of
the centre column of the allied army in the advance
in May 1813. Arriving at <em>Salamanca</em> on
the 26th of that month, the bridge and streets
were found barricaded, and a division of French
infantry, three squadrons of cavalry, and some
artillery, under General Villattes, were formed on
the heights above the ford of Santa Marta. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
British brigade passed the river at the ford, and
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons and first German
hussars removed the barricades and pushed
through the town, when the enemy fell back, but
was overtaken, and lost about two hundred men
killed and wounded, and two hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>The line of the Tormes was thus gained; that
of the Douro was soon afterwards won; and the
allied army, proudly confident in its distinguished
commander, advanced with a firmness which the
enemy could not withstand, and the Carion and
the Pisuerga were speedily passed: the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons forming, as usual, part of
the advance of the allied army, were engaged, on
the 12th of June, in forcing a division of the
enemy from a position near <em>Burgos</em>, when one
squadron, under Captain Milles, charged and
took some prisoners and a gun. The loss of the
regiment was limited to one man and one horse
killed; and one man and five horses wounded.</p>

<p>Unable to withstand the combinations of the
British general, the French destroyed Burgos
castle, and fell back with tumult and confusion
behind the Ebro; the British urged their march
towards the sources of that river, and traversing
a wild but beautiful region, turned the enemy's
position: the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> being in advance,
crossed the Ebro at the bridge of Frias on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
15th of June, and a patrol fell in with a body of
the enemy near Pancorba.</p>

<p>The enemy concentrated in front of Vittoria;
the Marquis of Wellington examined their position
on the 20th of June, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
skirmished with the French near the village of
<em>Huarte</em>.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, the long-expected battle
was fought near <em>Vittoria</em>, and the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons had the honour of sharing in a
conflict in which the French army sustained a
decisive overthrow. The regiment was attached
to the troops under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill, and supported the attacks of the infantry
and artillery; in the afternoon it was detached
to out-flank the enemy's left, and in the evening
it pursued the wreck of the French army along
the Pampeluna road, passing the whole of the
enemy's baggage, which had been abandoned.</p>

<p>The gallant bearing of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> on
this occasion was subsequently rewarded with the
royal authority to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>" on
their guidons and appointments; and an additional
honorary distinction was conferred on
their commanding officer, Colonel Hervey.</p>

<p>On the following day the regiment went in pursuit
of the remains of the French army, and on
the 24th of June, fell in with the rear-guard at a
pass about two leagues from <em>Pampeluna</em>, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
two battalions of riflemen drove the French infantry
through the pass, the horse artillery killed
several men, and dismounted one of the two pieces
of cannon brought off from Vittoria; at the same
time the leading squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>,
under Major Brotherton, charged and captured a
tumbril.</p>

<p>The French withdrew into the passes of the
Pyrenean mountains; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons
followed the enemy, and on the 28th of
June, a patrol of three men of the regiment,
under Lieutenant Ward, penetrating to the
village of <em>Ostiz</em>, found twenty-five French foot
soldiers regularly armed and formed up at the
village, who surrendered themselves prisoners of
war.</p>

<p>Advancing further into the mountains, a patrol
of six men of the regiment, commanded by
Lieutenant Clavering, encountered, on the 1st of
July, a body of infantry of the French rear-guard,
on the road from <em>Roncesvalles</em> to St. Jean-Pied-de-Port,
dispersed them, and took eighteen
prisoners.</p>

<p>A strong body of French troops occupied the
fruitful valley of <em>Bastan</em>, in the mountains, from
whence they were driven by the troops under Sir
Rowland Hill. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> were attached
to Lieut.-General Hill's division, and a squadron,
under Major Brotherton, was engaged, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
4th of July, with a body of the enemy near
<em>Almandoz</em>. The allied army was established in
positions in the mountains; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
took the out-post duty in front of Maya, and also
furnished posts of correspondence for several
weeks. At length, the French army having been
reinforced, re-organized, and placed under the
command of Marshal Soult, advanced and commenced
offensive operations. During the action
of the 26th of July, the regiment was employed
in carrying off the wounded from the pass of
Maya, and received the thanks of Sir Rowland
Hill. A squadron under Captain Milles was
similarly employed on the 30th of July, when Sir
Rowland Hill's post at <em>Arestegui</em> was attacked,
and another squadron under Major Brotherton
had a rencounter with the enemy.</p>

<p>The French having been repulsed, fell back in
disorder, and were pursued to the confines of
Spain. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> formed the van of Sir
Rowland Hill's division, and were engaged with
the enemy in the valley of <em>Bastan</em>, on the 1st and
2nd of August: on the 5th the regiment took the
out-post duty in front of Maya.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November the troops descended
from the Pyrenees, and traversed the mountain
passes by moonlight, until they arrived at the
line of piquets, where they halted until the day
dawned, when they transferred the seat of war to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
France, and taught the admirers of splendid but
unprincipled aggressions, that the day of retribution
had arrived. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons
were attached to Sir Rowland Hill's division,
and one squadron formed the advance-guard
to Marshal Beresford's corps. The enemy's position
on the <em>Nivelle</em> was forced, and the regiment
was united at Espelette on the following day.
The regimental baggage, which was attached to
the second division, fell into the hands of a party
of the enemy, in the rear of the pass of Maya, on
which occasion the regiment had one troop serjeant-major
and two private soldiers killed.</p>

<p>From the 15th of November to the 9th of
December the regiment furnished the out-posts
on the river Nive: it formed the advanced-guard
to Sir Rowland Hill's corps at the passage of the
<em>Nive</em> at the fords near Cambo, and the stream
being deep, two men and two horses were
drowned. On the 11th of December, a squadron,
under Major Brotherton, encountered a
body of the enemy in front of <em>Mendionda</em>, and
captured a convoy of corn, wine, and salt, and
made four men and horses of the escort prisoners.
On the 13th the regiment was engaged
with the French Light cavalry, under General
Pierre Soult, (brother of Marshal Soult), at
<em>Hasparren</em>, when Major Brotherton and Lieutenant
Southwell were taken prisoners; also one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
serjeant and one private soldier wounded, and
one taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The regiment took the out-post duty in front
of Urt on the 14th of December; and was formed
in brigade with the thirteenth light dragoons,
under Colonel Vivian, who was succeeded, in the
beginning of the following year, by Major-General
Fane.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>After reposing a short period in quarters
during very severe weather, the army resumed
operations in the middle of February, 1814, and
the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons took the van in
the advance against the enemy's left, which led
to the actions at <em>Hellette</em>, <em>Garris</em>, and <em>Sauveterre</em>.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February the battle of <em>Orthes</em>
was fought; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> shared in the
operations of the troops under Sir Rowland
Hill, and passing the stream above Orthes,
advanced towards the great road to St. Sever,
thus operating against the enemy's left. The
French were overpowered and driven from the
field; the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons earned
another inscription, the word '<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>,' for their
guidons and appointments, and Colonel Hervey
was rewarded with another honorary distinction.</p>

<p>The French fell back in disorder, the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
followed the enemy; crossed the Adour
on the 1st of March, and, continuing the pursuit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
were engaged, on the following day, at <em>Aire</em>, from
whence the French were driven by the troops
under Sir Rowland Hill. Serjeant Vernor, and
privates Craig and Rose, distinguished themselves
on this occasion.</p>

<p>A party, favourable to the house of Bourbon,
was known to exist in this part of France, and
Marshal Soult sent a body of troops to <em>Pau</em>
on the night of the 7th of March, to arrest the
nobles who had assembled to welcome the arrival
of the Duke D'Angouleme; but Major-General
Fane had arrived at Pau with a brigade of
infantry and two regiments of cavalry, and defeated
the enemy's design. The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons, with two guns attached, made a
strong patrol to Pau on the 7th of March, and
on the following day fell in with the French detachment,
and Captain Townsend and four private
soldiers were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Some offensive movements were made by the
enemy on the 13th and 14th of March, and General
Pierre Soult proceeded with three regiments of
cavalry to <em>Clarac</em>, on the Pau road, to intercept the
communication with that town, and to menace
the right flank of the allies. The piquet of the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> at Clarac, repulsed the enemy
on the morning of 14th of March, but Captain
Babington was taken prisoner. In the evening
the piquet under Captain Badcock was attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by the whole of the fifth regiment of chasseurs
and being reinforced by a squadron under Captain
Milles, kept its ground until another squadron
arrived under Captain Anderson, when the
French were repulsed with loss. Captain Milles
was rewarded with the brevet rank of Major.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March the regiment repulsed
an attack of the enemy in front of <em>Castel Paget</em>.
On the 18th at daylight, the army was in movement;
the French right was turned by the
valley of the Adour, and their out-posts driven
back upon <em>Lembege</em>: the leading squadron of the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, under Captain Anderson, was
engaged with the French on the Lembege
road, and Lieutenant Lyons was killed.</p>

<p>A squadron of the regiment, under Captain
Milles, was attached to Lieut.-General Stewart's
division, and was engaged, on the 19th of March,
near <em>Vic Bigorre</em>; on the 20th the regiment took
part in the affair at <em>Tarbes</em>, and assumed the out-post
duty in the evening; and it was in advance
during the march of the army towards Toulouse
on the 22nd of that month.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons had the honor
of serving at the battle of <em>Toulouse</em> on the 10th
of April; they were attached to the troops under
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, and took part
in the operations by which the French army was
driven from its ground. Hostilities were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
afterwards terminated; Napoleon Buonaparte
abdicated the throne of France, and the Bourbon
dynasty was restored.</p>

<p>Thus terminated, with glory to the British
arms, a war in which the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>, the
Duchess of York's Own Regiment of Light Dragoons,
had acquired a high reputation; it had
become justly celebrated for the excellent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit-de-corps</i>
which pervaded the ranks, and especially
for the superior style in which the officers and
soldiers had, during several years, performed the
duties of piquets, patrols, videttes, and other services
which devolve upon a corps employed in
the out-post duty.</p>

<p>At the termination of the contest, the regiment
marched into quarters at Monte Marsan,
where the reputation it had acquired
occasioned it to be selected from among the other
cavalry corps of the army, to take part in the
contest between Great Britain and the United
States of North America. The regiment marched
to Bourdeaux in May, and being there reviewed
by Major-General Lord Dalhousie, was complimented
on its appearance and efficiency; but the
order for its embarkation for America was countermanded.</p>

<p>The regiment marched from Bourdeaux to
Calais, where it embarked for England, and
landing at Dover on the 17th of July, proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
from thence to the vicinity of London. It was
reviewed on Hounslow Heath, by His Royal
Highness the Duke of York, who complimented
Colonel Hervey on the appearance and efficiency
of the several troops, adding, "They appear as if
they had never been on service." After the
review the regiment joined the depôt at Weymouth.</p>

<p>The non-effectives during the five years and a
half the regiment had been on foreign service,
including men invalided and sent home, and
horses cast and sold, were 654 non-commissioned
officers and private soldiers, and 1564 troop
horses. From the period of its leaving Ireland
in 1795, it had been recruited from the counties
of Worcester, Warwick, Salop, and Bucks, with
some volunteers from the fencible cavalry in 1800,
and from the royal waggon train in 1810.</p>

<p>The contest in North America, which had
been recommenced in 1813, had not terminated,
and in the autumn two squadrons of the regiment,
dismounted, embarked, and sailing from
Plymouth, arrived, on the 24th of November, at
Jamaica, where an expedition was assembled under
Major-General (afterwards Lord) Keane, for an
attempt on <em>New Orleans</em>, situate on the river Mississippi,
one hundred and ten miles from the
Gulf of Mexico. The approach to this place
was particularly difficult; and when the fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
arrived, on the 10th of December, off the coast
of Louisiana, the troops had to be removed into
light vessels, and eventually into open boats, for
the tedious navigation of Lake Bargne, and were
afterwards obliged to traverse a difficult morass.
Emerging from the morass, the soldiers were opposed
by such immense bodies of Americans,
with extensively fortified lines and batteries, and
armed vessels on the river, that after extraordinary
efforts, and exhibitions of valour and perseverance,
the enterprise was relinquished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>In the attack on the enemy's lines, on the 8th
January, 1815, the two squadrons served dismounted.
Major-General the Honourable Sir
Edward Pakenham, K.C.B., was killed; Major-Generals
Gibbs and Keane were dangerously
wounded; and the command devolved on Major-General
Lambert, who stated in his public despatch,
'The conduct of the two squadrons of the
<span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons, latterly under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Baker, previously of
Major Milles, has been the admiration of every
one, by the cheerfulness with which they have
performed all descriptions of service.'</p>

<p>The troops returned on board the fleet; and
one boat, containing Lieutenant Brydges, Cornet
Hammond, one serjeant-major, and thirty-nine
rank and file of the regiment, was captured
by the Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Hostilities were soon afterwards terminated by a
treaty of peace; and the two squadrons arrived in
England, and joined the regiment at Hounslow
in May; a third squadron which had embarked
for America, also rejoined the head-quarters.</p>

<p>This year the regiment was authorized to bear
the word "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>" on its guidons and appointments,
in commemoration of its services in
Portugal, Spain, and France.</p>

<p>Napoleon Buonaparte having quitted Elba, and
returned to France, and having regained the
throne of that kingdom, war was immediately recommenced;
three squadrons of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
having sailed for America, the regiment was prevented
sharing in the contest which followed; but
Colonel Hervey and Major Percy served on the
staff of Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>In December the regiment embarked at Bristol
for Ireland, and landed at Waterford and Cork in
January, 1816: at the same time the establishment
was reduced to eight troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817<br />1818</div>

<p>A further reduction took place in the two
following years; and in 1818 Captains Townsend
and Badcock received the rank of major in the
army for services in the field during the Peninsular
war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>During its stay in Ireland the regiment was
several times commended for its conduct and
discipline by Major-General White, and Major-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Sir Sydney Beckwith: and on the 27th
of May, 1819, it was formed in column and received
the personal thanks of Sir George Beckwith,
commanding the forces in that part of the
United Kingdom. The regiment embarked from
Dublin in June, and landed at Liverpool on the
11th of that month.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span>
light dragoons lost their commanding officer,
Colonel <span class="smcap">Sir Felton Bathurst Hervey, Baronet</span>,
who died on the 24th September, 1819, and
whose death was regretted by the corps.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> His
services had been rewarded with the dignity of a
Baronet, and the following distinctions; a cross
for the battles of Fuentes d'Onor, Salamanca,
Vittoria, and Orthes; a medal for the battle of
Waterloo; Companion of the Bath; Companion
of the Guelphic Order; the Russian Order of
Wladimir; Maria Theresa of Austria; St. Henry
of Saxony; Tower and Sword of Portugal;
Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria; and the Prussian
Order of Merit. He was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel
Baker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>In 1821 the establishment was reduced to six
troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1822, the regiment was reviewed
on Hounslow-heath, with the first and
second life guards, royal horse guards, tenth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
fifteenth hussars, and a brigade of horse of artillery,
by His Royal Highness the Duke of York, the
Commander-in-Chief, who was pleased to express
his approbation of the appearance and movements
of the troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1823 General the Earl of
Bridgewater died, and was succeeded in the
colonelcy of the regiment by Lieut.-General Sir
John Ormsby Vandeleur, G.C.B., whose regiment,
the nineteenth light dragoons, had been disbanded
two years previously.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>The regiment remained in England until April,
1825, when it embarked at Bideford for Ireland,
landed at Waterford, and marched to Cork and
Fermoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826<br />1827<br />1828</div>

<p>In 1826 the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> marched to Dublin,
where its appearance, discipline, and interior
economy, were commended by Major-General Sir
Colquhoun Grant, K.C.B., at the inspections in
June and September. From Dublin the regiment
marched in January, 1827, to Athlone, Ballinrobe,
Gort, and Loughrea; it returned to Dublin in
March, 1828; was commended for its appearance,
efficiency and discipline, and also for its good
conduct while in Ireland, by Lieut.-General Sir
George Murray, K.C.B., commanding the forces
in that country, at the inspection on the 22nd of
March; and embarked for Liverpool on the 26th
of that month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>From Liverpool the regiment marched to Birmingham
and Coventry, and while in these
quarters Lieut.-Colonel Baker retired,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and was
succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel John Townsend, by
commission dated the 16th of April 1829. In
May, 1829, the regiment marched to Leeds,
Burnley, and Rochdale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>In April, 1830, the regiment proceeded to
Brighton and Chichester, and its appearance,
discipline, and interior economy, were commended
by Major-General Sir Hussey Vivian at the
inspection on the 24th of May.</p>

<p>The regiment was inspected at Brighton on the
19th of June by its colonel, Lieut.-General Sir
John Ormsby Vandeleur, G.C.B. who was pleased
to express himself 'much gratified by the highly
military appearance of the regiment, the celerity
and precision of its movements in the field, and
the clean and orderly state of the barracks, as
well as the fine condition of the horses, all of
which prove the zeal and ability of the commanding
officer, and the active assistance he
receives from the other officers, as well as the
steady good conduct of the non-commissioned
officers and privates, which he shall not fail to
report to the Commander-in-Chief. He requests
Lieut.-Colonel Townsend to accept his thanks,
and also to communicate them to the officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and to the regiment. He cannot omit observing
the excellent management of the school, and the
great progress of the pupils.'</p>

<p>In the same month Lieut.-General Sir John
Ormsby Vandeleur was removed to the sixteenth
light dragoons, and was succeeded by Major-General
Sir Edward Kerrison, Baronet.</p>

<p>In July the regiment marched to London, and
was reviewed by His Majesty, King William IV.
on the 26th of that month, who was graciously
pleased to express his royal approbation of its appearance,
and to command that it should in future
bear the distinguished title of "<span class="smcap">The Fourteenth</span>,
or <span class="smcap">The King's</span>, instead of the <em>Duchess of
York's Own</em>, <span class="smcap">Regiment of Light Dragoons</span>."
This distinctive appellation occasioned the regiment
to discontinue the <em>orange</em>, and, as a Royal
regiment, to assume the <em>scarlet</em> facing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>From London the regiment marched to Birmingham
and Coventry, where it was stationed
until July, 1831, when the head-quarters were
removed to Gloucester.</p>

<p>In October, 1831, the political feelings of the
lower classes of the city of Bristol being in a
highly excited state, and riotous proceedings being
anticipated, a troop of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth Light
Dragoons</span> (with one of the third dragoon guards)
was ordered to the vicinity, for the purpose of
aiding the magistracy in the preservation of order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
The arrival of the Recorder, Sir Charles Wetherell,
on Saturday the 29th October, for the purpose of
holding the sessions, was the immediate cause of
the outbreak. Large bodies of the populace
assembled from every quarter, parading the streets,
throwing stones at the authorities, breaking
windows, and committing other acts of violence.
This continued throughout the day; but it was
not until evening, that serious consequences began
to be apprehended. At dusk, the mob attacked
and forcibly entered the mansion house, the Riot
Act was consequently proclaimed, and the troops
were called to the immediate scene of outrage.
They cleared the streets in the neighbourhood of
the mansion house, but there not being at hand
a sufficient body of constables to act in concert
with the troops, the mob still retained possession
of the courts and alleys of the city, whither the
dragoons were unable to follow them. On Sunday
the rioters assembled in greater numbers, and
during that day, and the following night, succeeded
in destroying the mansion house, custom
house, excise office, the bishop's palace, and a
vast amount of private property.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 31st October, an
additional troop of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons
arrived, and Major Beckwith, who had preceded
it, (travelling post from head-quarters at
Gloucester), having concerted with the magistrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
who saw the necessity of energetic measures,
placed himself at the head of the squadron, and
proceeded against the rioters, who were engaged
in plundering the cellars of the bishop's palace,
which they had destroyed on the day before: the
troops were assailed with bottles, stones, &amp;c., but
they quickly dispersed the mob; and it having
been ascertained that in another part of the city
the rioters were about commencing the destruction
of the remaining portion of Queen-square, the
squadron of the <span class="smcap"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'was in italic font'">Fourteenth</ins></span> proceeded thither,
and put the mob to flight; thence it repaired to
the jail, which was regained possession of, and
restored to the charge of the civil authorities.
The squadron then traversed the quays and wharfs,
dispersing every riotous assemblage with which
it came in contact, and driving out and pursuing,
for some miles, a large body of colliers who had
been attracted to the scene of outrage. To this
energetic conduct of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth Light Dragoons</span>,
under Major Beckwith, may be ascribed
the restoration of tranquillity and the preservation
of the remainder of the city of Bristol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>In June, 1832, the regiment was removed to
Hounslow, and was employed on the King's duty,
in furnishing escorts for their Majesties and the
royal family, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1832 the <em>King's Crest</em> was permitted to be
borne on the Appointments; and the <em>Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Eagle</em>, which had been carried as the regimental
badge from the year 1798, was authorised to be
continued on the second and third corners of the
Regimental Guidon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>In March, 1833, the regiment embarked at
Bristol for Dublin, from whence it marched in
April, 1834, to Longford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>On the 24th May, 1834, His Majesty commanded
that the use of Guidons in regiments
of Light Dragoons should be discontinued. The
Guidons in regiments of <em>Hussars</em> and <em>Lancers</em>
had been directed on 12th March, 1834, to be
discontinued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835<br />1836</div>

<p>In May, 1835, the regiment was removed to
Dundalk, and in May, 1836, it embarked at Belfast
for Glasgow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed at Glasgow until
the spring of 1837, when it marched to Edinburgh,
and occupied Piershill barracks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838<br />1839<br />1840</div>

<p>In the summer of 1838 the regiment left Scotland;
it was stationed at Birmingham until
April, 1839, when it marched to Hounslow, from
whence it proceeded to Dorchester in May,
1840.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Dorchester until the
30th of March, 1841, when it was removed to
Canterbury, where it arrived on the 10th of April,
preparatory to its being embarked for Bombay
to relieve the fourth light dragoons.</p>

<p>The regiment being augmented to the India
establishment, Major William Havelock, K.H.
(from the fourth light dragoons) was promoted to
be the second Lieut.-Colonel, and Captain Edward
Harvey was promoted to be second Major, on the
30th April, 1841.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May, the first division, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel Townsend, embarked
at Gravesend for India in the freight ship
"Repulse," and arrived at Bombay on the 8th of
September, from whence it proceeded to Kirkee:
the second division embarked at Gravesend on
board of the freight ship "Reliance" on the 14th
of June, under the command of Major Barton,
and landing at Bombay on the 5th of October
following, marched to join the regiment at Kirkee,
where it arrived on the 13th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842<br />1843<br />1844</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light dragoons during the
years 1842, 1843, and 1844, continued to be
stationed at Kirkee: two squadrons however
proceeded on field service to Kolapoor in October,
1844.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Townsend received leave from
India, and he died at Castle Townsend, in Ireland,
on the 22nd April, 1845.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He was succeeded by

<p>The two squadrons of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dragoons, which had proceeded on field service
in the southern Mahratta country, rejoined the
head-quarters on the 19th of March, 1845, and
in the following December the regiment marched
from Kirkee, en route to Mhow and Agra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846</div>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1846, the regiment
marched from Agra to Meerut, arriving at the
latter station on the 16th of that month; and in
April, 1846, the regiment proceeded to Umballa,
where it has continued to the end of the year
1846.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The statement of the services of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth,
or the King's, Light Dragoons</span>, from
the period of the formation of the regiment in
1715 to the present time, (as given in the preceding
pages,) affords abundant proofs of the value
of its services abroad, as well as at home; and its
order, discipline, good conduct, and bravery,
have, on numerous occasions, been attested by
the general officers under whom the regiment
has been employed.</p>

<p>During the Peninsular War, from 1808 to
1814, the <em>Fourteenth</em> and <em>Sixteenth</em> Light Dragoons
were principally employed on the important
duties of <em>out-posts</em>, on which the safety of
an army in the field, and the success of its movements
greatly depend.</p>

<p>In the mode of performing these peculiar and
important services, the Fourteenth and Sixteenth
Light Dragoons, under the direction of active
and intelligent officers, acquired the confidence
of the Commander of the Forces, and of the
division of the army of which they formed a
portion.</p>

<p>At the period of the conclusion of this Record,
(1846) the regiment is reported to be in a high
state of efficiency, and in readiness to evince its
prowess whenever the public service may again
require its assistance.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 22nd July, 1715.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">James Dormer</span> obtained a commission at the augmentation
of the army in 1701, and his attention to duty, zeal
for the service, and personal bravery, evinced while serving
under the celebrated John, Duke of Marlborough, were
rewarded in 1707 with the rank of colonel in the army,
and he was soon afterwards appointed colonel of a newly-raised
Irish regiment of foot, with which he embarked
for Spain in 1709. He distinguished himself at the
battle of Saragossa, and in the advance to Madrid, in
1710, but was surrounded and made prisoner, with his
regiment, in the mountains of Castile in the following
winter. He was exchanged, and on arriving in England,
he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General; and
in 1712, he succeeded Lord Mohun, who was killed in a
duel with the Duke of Hamilton, in the command of a
regiment of foot, which was disbanded at the peace of
Utrecht. At the augmentation in the summer of 1715,
he was commissioned to raise a corps of dragoons,&mdash;the
present <span class="smcap">Fourteenth, the King's Regiment of Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Dragoons</span>. He commanded a brigade at the attack of
the rebels at Preston, and was wounded at the storming
of the avenue leading to Lancaster. He was removed in
1720, to the sixth foot; he was promoted to the rank of
Major-General in 1727, and to that of Lieut.-General in
1735. In 1738, he was rewarded with the colonelcy of
the first troop of horse grenadier guards, and he retained
this appointment until his decease in 1742.</p>

He also served in the wars of Queen Anne; was
promoted to the Lieut.-Colonelcy of Munden's regiment
of foot, with which he served in Spain, and signalized
himself at the battle of Saragossa in 1710; but was
made prisoner at Brihuega. He was shortly afterwards
exchanged, and at the close of the campaign of 1711, he
was rewarded with the rank of colonel in the army. At
the peace of Utrecht, his regiment was disbanded; and
in the summer of 1715, he was appointed Lieut.-Colonel
of the thirteenth dragoons. In 1720 he was promoted to
the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> dragoons, from which

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
